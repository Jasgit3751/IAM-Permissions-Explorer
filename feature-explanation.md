✅IAM Permissions Explorer(Feature Explanation):-

The IAM Permissions Explorer is designed to help cloud security engineers quickly identify and fix excessive or unused permissions across multiple cloud accounts.
In many organizations, IAM permissions keep increasing over time as users change roles, projects evolve, and temporary access is never cleaned up. This often leads to over-privileged identities, which increases the risk of security incidents.
This solution provides a simple and risk-focused view that enables engineers to:

- Detect over-privileged identities  
- Identify unused permissions  
- Understand real permission usage  
- Safely remediate access  

The main goal is to reduce manual review effort and improve the organization’s least-privilege posture.

✅Key Features
1. Centralized IAM Explorer Dashboard

The IAM Explorer provides a unified table view of identities across cloud accounts. Users can search, filter by risk level, and quickly identify high-risk identities.

2. Identity Risk & Usage Details

The Identity Details screen provides deep visibility into permission usage for a selected identity. Summary cards highlight total permissions, unused permissions, and high-risk permissions.

3. Guided Permission Remediation

The remediation workflow provides recommended actions such as removing unused permissions or applying least-privilege policies. Users can preview changes and selectively apply fixes.
