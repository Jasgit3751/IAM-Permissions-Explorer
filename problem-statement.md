🔹 Problem Statement
As we all know in many organizations when they use cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform, users and services often accumulate excessive IAM permissions over time. Due to this security teams struggle with below problems:-
(A) Quickly identify over-privileged users.
(B) Detect unused permissions.
(C) Understand real permission usage.
(D) Fix risks without breaking access.
In Cloud environments existing IAM views are usually too complex, scattered, or not risk-focused, which makes permission reviews slow and error-prone so there is a need for a simple IAM Permissions Explorer that helps security engineers easily spot and fix excessive or unused permissions across cloud accounts.
